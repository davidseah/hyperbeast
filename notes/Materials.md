# Material
In the real world, each object reacts differently to light. 
Steel objects are often shinier than a clay vase for example and a wooden container does not react the same to light as a steel container.
Each object also responds differently to a specular highlights.
Some objects reflect the light without too much scattering resulting in a small highlights and others scatter a lot giving the highlight a larger radius.
If we want to simulate several types of objects in OpenGL we have to define material properties specific to each object. 

In the previous tutorial we specified an object and light color to define the visual output of the object, combined with an ambient and specular intensity component. 
```
int main
